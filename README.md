During this internship, I worked on :

🔹 Cleaning and analyzing data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib).

🔹 Creating interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI.

🔹 Writing optimized SQL queries for data extraction and reporting.

🔹 Documenting and visualizing insights using Jupyter Notebook.

I’m truly grateful to the mentors and team at Unified Mentor for their guidance and support throughout the internship. 🙏
